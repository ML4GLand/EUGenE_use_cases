# Use cases
This repository contains attmepts to reproduce foundational research in machine learning for genomics using EUGENe and other ML4G tools. It also lends itself nicely for aggregating interesting analyses and visualizations of data that extend beyond the scope of the original research. We hope to encourage others to contribute their own use cases and analyses to this repository.

# Contributing
We will be setting up more formal contribution guidelines in the future. For now, we are accepting many different forms of contribution. Please feel free to submit a pull request with your use case. You can fork the repo, and add your own analysis or use case
